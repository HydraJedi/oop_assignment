## What is SDG13?

SDG13 is the 13th goal of seventeen goals called the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs were created by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2015 as part of a plan for a better future. The SDGs are a set of goals that aim to promote peace and prosperity for people and the planet.

SDG13 is all about taking immediate action to fight climate change and its effects.

SDG 13 has five targets to accomplish by 2030. These targets address a wide range of issues related to climate action. The first three targets focus on specific outcomes: improving the ability to withstand and recover from climate-related disasters, integrating climate change measures into policies and planning, and enhancing knowledge and capacity to tackle climate change. The remaining two targets are aimed at implementing the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and promoting mechanisms to enhance planning and management capabilities. Along with each target, there are indicators that help assess overall progress.

one of the requirements is to Design the program with at least two types of users in mind: Government (Admin) and Public (Normal User)

so we are assuming that regulators and decision makers will be using our app beside the public.

Fighting climate change from its roots is a complex and multifaceted problem that involves dealing with regulators, individuals of various backgrounds, technology, and engineering. As Java developers, we can only focus on two areas: people and technology. This makes it much easier to build an app that tackles the first and third main targets in real life, as the other three are more of a policy issue rather than a problem that can be solved with technology.

Although there can also be some applications that can help with the remaining three targets, such as an app that collects real-time data that can be used by decision makers, obtaining such data can be difficult without access to lots of restricted or paid content. 

Furthermore, it would be more appropriate to build an app targeted towards a specify niche with a specific need and a clear value proposition, rather than trying to convince them to use a more general app that deals with "individuals" without considering their age, background, financial status, or any other differences they might have especially if we chose to build an app around the third target.

These targets can be translated into practical solutions and actions at the individual, community, and organizational levels. For example, an app can be developed to provide information and resources for disaster preparedness, such as emergency evacuation routes, real-time weather updates, and tips for minimizing the impact of climate-related disasters.

An app can also help governments incorporate climate change measures into their policies, such as providing information on sustainable development, energy conservation, and carbon footprint tracking. It can also serve as a platform for sharing success stories and best practices in climate action, as well as for monitoring progress towards achieving SDG13 targets.

Enhancing knowledge and capacity to tackle climate change can be supported through educational apps that provide information on climate change science, mitigation and adaptation strategies, and opportunities for engagement in climate-related initiatives.

On the other hand, the remaining two targets of SDG 13 focus on implementing the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and promoting mechanisms to enhance planning and management capabilities. These targets are more oriented towards institutional-level policies, regulations, and decision-making processes. While important, they may not be as directly applicable to an app-based solution, as they primarily require coordination and collaboration among governments, organizations, and international bodies.

Overall, while the first three targets of SDG 13 are more amenable to app development, the remaining two targets can still benefit from digital tools and platforms to support their implementation and monitoring processes.

- [ ]  Use at least one access modifier to distinguish between the Public and Admin users
- [ ]  Organized Source Code

We have a very tight time constraint that will affect our design choices. Although we are free to choose between a GUI or a CLI, GUI is hands down the better choice.

For GUI apps, JavaFX seems like a good option for a Java beginner, but the web is just much better. It's accessible to Android, iOS, and lots of other devices.

Developing an "extremely attractive" app with CLI is tricky, but it's not impossible.

In addition, I believe that creating a CLI initially and then building a GUI later would be the appropriate approach. Even if we ultimately want to create a GUI, creating a CLI is much easier. It will allow us to write the business logic and features and to test and debug them much more easily than if we tried to test a feature every time with the GUI.

This will allow us to create an entire functional app and be more flexible if we don't have enough time to build the GUI.
